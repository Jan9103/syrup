# Syrup (prompt)

A modular prompt for nushell.  

**PROJECT STATUS: ALPHA**
* The parts i care about work
* You can add what you want with custom modules
* It is not (yet) stable and config options/.. might get changed at any point
* The documentation is bad
* The only reason i published it (already) is that i don't think I'd have the motivation to finish it otherwise
